# ML-projects

For the decision tree project, it was a mini project and it was completed solely by me. 

For the covid project, it was a group project. We were required to analyze the given dataset and build a prediction model for new cases. I am in charge of the final neural network model and Q4. 

For the sentiment analysis project, it was a group project. We were required to analyze the given dataset and build a rating prediction model given comments as input. I am in charge of the GloVe LSTM GRU model and the final GloVe + BERT model. 

For COMP4651 project, I analyzed owid-COVID data using spark.
